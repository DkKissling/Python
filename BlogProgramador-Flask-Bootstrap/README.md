# Personal Programmer Blog
---
This repository contains the source code of a personal blog developed by Juan Tobares and Guillermo Kissling. The blog is built using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap, providing a platform for programmers to share their experience, projects, and knowledge.

## Description
The Personal Programmer Blog serves as a platform for programmers to share their experiences, projects, and knowledge with the community. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to showcase your latest project or a newcomer seeking guidance, our blog aims to provide valuable insights and resources for all levels of expertise.

## Setup and Usage
Follow the steps below to set up and run the personal blog on your local environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/personal-blog.git
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment using venv. Open a terminal and run the following command (replace "environment_name" with the name you want to give to the environment):

    ```
    python -m venv environment_name
    ```

    If the above command doesn't work, try using python3 instead of python:

    ```
    python3 -m venv environment_name
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment. In the same terminal, run the following command:

    ```
    source environment_name/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the project dependencies. Make sure you are in the root of the project and run the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Start the server. Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```
    flask run --reload
    ```

6. Now you can access the personal programmer blog in your browser through the address http://localhost:5000.
